Checks for string literal concatenation at
the end of a line.

@safety
    This cop is unsafe because it cannot be guaranteed that the
    receiver is a string, in which case replacing `<<` with `\`
    would result in a syntax error.

    For example, this would be a false positive:
    [source,ruby]
    ----
    array << 'foo' <<
             'bar' <<
             'baz'
    ----

### Example:

    # bad
    some_str = 'ala' +
               'bala'

    some_str = 'ala' <<
               'bala'

    # good
    some_str = 'ala' \
               'bala'
