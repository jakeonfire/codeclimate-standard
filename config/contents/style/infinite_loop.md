Use `Kernel#loop` for infinite loops.

@safety
    This cop is unsafe as the rule should not necessarily apply if the loop
    body might raise a `StopIteration` exception; contrary to other infinite
    loops, `Kernel#loop` silently rescues that and returns `nil`.

### Example:
    # bad
    while true
      work
    end

    # good
    loop do
      work
    end
