Checks for ambiguous ranges.

Ranges have quite low precedence, which leads to unexpected behavior when
using a range with other operators. This cop avoids that by making ranges
explicit by requiring parenthesis around complex range boundaries (anything
that is not a literal: numerics, strings, symbols, etc.).

This cop can be configured with `RequireParenthesesForMethodChains` in order to
specify whether method chains (including `self.foo`) should be wrapped in parens
by this cop.

NOTE: Regardless of this configuration, if a method receiver is a basic literal
value, it will be wrapped in order to prevent the ambiguity of `1..2.to_a`.

@safety
    The cop autocorrects by wrapping the entire boundary in parentheses, which
    makes the outcome more explicit but is possible to not be the intention of the
    programmer. For this reason, this cop's autocorrect is unsafe (it will not
    change the behavior of the code, but will not necessarily match the
    intent of the program).

### Example:
    # bad
    x || 1..2
    (x || 1..2)
    1..2.to_a

    # good, unambiguous
    1..2
    'a'..'z'
    :bar..:baz
    MyClass::MIN..MyClass::MAX
    @min..@max
    a..b
    -a..b

    # good, ambiguity removed
    x || (1..2)
    (x || 1)..2
    (x || 1)..(y || 2)
    (1..2).to_a

### Example: RequireParenthesesForMethodChains: false (default)
    # good
    a.foo..b.bar
    (a.foo)..(b.bar)

### Example: RequireParenthesesForMethodChains: true
    # bad
    a.foo..b.bar

    # good
    (a.foo)..(b.bar)
