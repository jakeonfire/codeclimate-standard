Checks for uses of `Integer#times` that will never yield
(when the integer ``<= 0``) or that will only ever yield once
(`1.times`).

@safety
    This cop is unsafe as `times` returns its receiver, which is
    *usually* OK, but might change behavior.

### Example:
    # bad
    -5.times { do_something }
    0.times { do_something }
    1.times { do_something  }
    1.times { |i| do_something(i) }

    # good
    do_something
    do_something(1)
