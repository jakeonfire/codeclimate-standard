Checks for the first argument to `IO.read`, `IO.binread`, `IO.write`, `IO.binwrite`,
`IO.foreach`, and `IO.readlines`.

If argument starts with a pipe character (`'|'`) and the receiver is the `IO` class,
a subprocess is created in the same way as `Kernel#open`, and its output is returned.
`Kernel#open` may allow unintentional command injection, which is the reason these
`IO` methods are a security risk.
Consider to use `File.read` to disable the behavior of subprocess invocation.

@safety
    This cop is unsafe because false positive will occur if the variable passed as
    the first argument is a command that is not a file path.

### Example:

    # bad
    IO.read(path)
    IO.read('path')

    # good
    File.read(path)
    File.read('path')
    IO.read('| command') # Allow intentional command invocation.
