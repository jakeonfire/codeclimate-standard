Checks for the use of YAML class methods which have
potential security issues leading to remote code execution when
loading from an untrusted source.

NOTE: Ruby 3.1+ (Psych 4) uses `Psych.load` as `Psych.safe_load` by default.

@safety
    The behavior of the code might change depending on what was
    in the YAML payload, since `YAML.safe_load` is more restrictive.

### Example:
    # bad
    YAML.load("--- !ruby/object:Foo {}") # Psych 3 is unsafe by default

    # good
    YAML.safe_load("--- !ruby/object:Foo {}", [Foo])                    # Ruby 2.5  (Psych 3)
    YAML.safe_load("--- !ruby/object:Foo {}", permitted_classes: [Foo]) # Ruby 3.0- (Psych 3)
    YAML.load("--- !ruby/object:Foo {}", permitted_classes: [Foo])      # Ruby 3.1+ (Psych 4)
    YAML.dump(foo)
